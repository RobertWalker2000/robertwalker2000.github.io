							<h2>Pug Golf</h2>
							<p>Working as part of a small, multi-disciplinary team, I helped develop this cute pug-themed minigolf game. As one of two programmers on the project, I was responsible for core gameplay mechanics such as movement and camera controls, as well as collectables, power-ups, interactive level mechanics, and some elements of audio! </p>

							<h2>Honours Project</h2>
							<p>My honours project centred around assessing the effectiveness of gamified learning for teaching programming. To achieve this, I developed a simple game where the player needed to move to an end zone and shoot targets along the way. The catch was that none of the necessary behaviours for this were available, as this was up to the player to implement in order to learn about programming. To allow for these player-implemented behaviours I created and implemented a visual scripting system, using a mixture of blueprints for the UI and C++ for the underlying scripting system.</p>

							<h2>Audio Project</h2>
							<p>This application was created to develop and display my skills relating to audio programming. I used Wwise, integrated into Unity, to implement all sound present in the game. The application makes use of spatialisation (attenuation, panning, reverb) and dynamic audio techniques, applied to both sampled and synthesised sounds. It also makes use of my own custom occlusion code to affect sounds as they travel through obstacles on their way to the player. This occlusion also allows for different 'sound materials' to be applied to each mesh so that different objects affect sound at different rates.</p>

							<h2>Portal Gun</h2>
							<p>This project focused around developing a portal gun, inspired by the one in Valve's 'Portal' games. The portals conserve the player's momentum and orientation relative to the entry portal when teleporting, altering them to be consistent when exiting the second portal. The system was initially designed and implemented using the blueprinting system, but was re-implemented to exclusively use C++.</p>
